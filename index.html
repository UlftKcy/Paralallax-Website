                <p>
                    This is the invisible phase of the Moon, with the illuminated side of the Moon facing the Sun and
                    the night side facing Earth. In this phase, the Moon is in the same part of the sky as the Sun and
                    rises and sets with the Sun. Not only is the illuminated side facing away from the Earth, it’s also
                    up during the day! Remember, in this phase, the Moon doesn’t usually pass directly between Earth and
                    the Sun, due to the inclination of the Moon’s orbit. It only passes near the Sun from our
                    perspective on Earth.

                <p>
                    This silver sliver of a Moon occurs when the illuminated half of the Moon faces mostly away from
                    Earth, with only a tiny portion visible to us from our planet. It grows daily as the Moon’s orbit
                    carries the Moon’s dayside farther into view. Every day, the Moon rises a little bit later.

                <h3>First Quarter</h3>
                <p>
                    The Moon is now a quarter of the way through its monthly journey and you see half of its illuminated
                    side. People may casually call this a half moon, but remember, that’s not really what you’re
                    witnessing in the sky. You’re seeing just a slice of the entire Moon ― half of the illuminated half.
                    A first quarter moon rises around noon and sets around midnight. It’s high in the sky in the evening
                    and makes for excellent viewing.

                <h3>Waxing Gibbous</h3>
                <p>
                    Now most of the Moon’s dayside has come into view, and the Moon appears brighter in the sky.

                <p>
                    This is as close as we come to seeing the Sun’s illumination of the entire day side of the Moon (so,
                    technically, this would be the real half moon). The Moon is opposite the Sun, as viewed from Earth,
                    revealing the Moon’s dayside. A full moon rises around sunset and sets around sunrise. The Moon will
                    appear full for a couple of days before it moves into…

                <h3>Waning Gibbous</h3>
                <p>
                    As the Moon begins its journey back toward the Sun, the opposite side of the Moon now reflects the
                    Moon’s light. The lighted side appears to shrink, but the Moon’s orbit is simply carrying it out of
                    view from our perspective. The Moon rises later and later each night.

                <h3>Last Quarter</h3>
                <p>
                    The Moon looks like it’s half illuminated from the perspective of Earth, but really you’re seeing
                    half of the half of the Moon that’s illuminated by the Sun ― or a quarter. A last quarter moon, also
                    known as a third quarter moon, rises around midnight and sets around noon.

                <h3>Waning Crescent</h3>
                <p>
                    The Moon is nearly back to the point in its orbit where its dayside directly faces the Sun, and all
                    that we see from our perspective is a thin curve.
